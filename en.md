## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<a id="where"></a>
- **Where do we play?**

  We usually meet at indoor courts (_pay to use_) like Polideportivo Benimaclet, Pabellón Municipal Benicalap or any other venue that's available.
  
  However, sometimes we meet in free public outdoor courts in different parts of the city.

<a id="how-often"></a>
- **How often do we play?**
  
  We usually meet on weekends, for now.

  We would like to organize games during the week as well, but we have not been able to do it yet.

<a id="how-long"></a>
- **For how long do we play?**
  
  We usually play for 90 minutes.

<a id="how-many"></a>
- **What is the player limit?**

  Usually, up to 18 players (three teams of five and one sub each) but this can change if we booked a second court.

<a id="how-much"></a>
- **How much does it cost?**

  When we reserve at indoor courts (_pay to use_) price starts at €4, depending on each venue and the amount of time booked.
  
  You will have to give the playing fee to the organizer - Bizum preferred. If you pay cash, don't bring big notes, we are not a bank.
  
  When we play in _free public courts_, then there is no cost (it's free!)

<a id="how-to"></a>
- **How do I sign up to play?**

  In our [Telegram group](https://linktr.ee/valenciaheat) whenever we organize a new game, each member joins individually by sending a simple message showing intention to play. Then, we make a list of players and a waiting list, if there is a free spot, put your name on the list. Finally head to the indicated place when the time comes.

  This list is mostly to know who and how many of us will be going, so that we can also book the place for more or less time according to the amount of attendees.

  Have a look at the chat history to see how we do it.

<a id="bring"></a>
- **What should I bring?**

  If you have any, you could bring a ball, an air pump, water and cash to pay for the reservation (if applicable).

<a id="can-i"></a>
- **Can I organize a game?**

  Any member of the group can organize a game whenever they wish.

<a id="no-show"></a>
- **What if I signed up for a game but cannot attend anymore?**

  If you sign up for a game but cannot attend anymore, you must remove your name from the list with enough time so that someone else can participate instead.

  When the game has a payment fee (usually on indoor courts), if you don't remove your name from the list and you don't show up to play, you will receive a warning. If you receive three no-show warnings, you will be banned from the group.

<a id="pol-mun-booking"></a>
- **Polideportivos municipales - how far in advance can I reserve?**

  Earliest is Tuesdays morning. 
  
  On Tuesdays you can call the polideportivo (Benimaclet, Benicalap, etc) and check the availability for the week. The reservation must be made in person at the reception.

  Federated clubs and schools that use the place have priority of usage. Monday nights these institutions reserve the time slots for them. Whatever is left, would be available for us.
